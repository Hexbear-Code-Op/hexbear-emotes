# Emotes Guidelines
_____
**CONTENT GUIDELINES**

Emojis must be:

    Visually clear at a small size
    Have a transparent background to the greatest degree possible
    Display a clear emotion or purpose
    If including text, should be properly sized to be readable
    "Evergreen" and not something that will be irrelevant after the next news cycle
    Formatted in PNG, GIF, or SVG to make WhyEssEff's file optimization cycles easier.

The following is not allowed:

    No fascist symbolism, no matter how many layers of irony it's under.
    To further expand: No nazi imagery. This includes swastikas, hitler, SS symbols, etc.
    Pepe emojis
    Anything Vaush related
    Nothing that could be misconstrued as anti-semitic. This includes things like burning israeli flag emojis.
    Nothing sexually explicit is allowed.
    No sectarianism in submissions. Pro-tendency content is fine, but we will not accept content degrading specific tendencies.

**NAMING CONVENTIONS**

Must:
    Be lowercase, except for cases where CamelCase is an enunciation method, see further below.
    Be related to the content of the emoji.
    Be searchable by the average person. Try to include names of people in their respective emojis, and attempt to follow categorizations set by previous emojis if applicable.
